			<h2>What is it?</h2>
			<p>
				Picking a movie with other people is harder than it should be. Cinematch makes it easy by
				letting everyone swipe through movies on their own. When you all like the same one, you get
				a match.
			</p>

			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p>
				Start by creating a session. Choose the types of movies you want - filter by year, genre, or
				streaming service - and give the session a name you can share with friends.<br /><br />
				You'll also set how many likes it takes to make a match. For example, if there are three of
				you, set it to three.<br /><br />
				Once everyone joins and starts swiping, Cinematch will let you know as soon as a movie gets
				enough likes.
