			<h2>What is it for?</h2>
			<p>
				Trying to pick a movie to watch with someone else can be a nightmare. Cinematch lets you individually swipe through movies and decide what you want to watch, and then notifies you when everyone in your group has liked the same movie. 
			</p>
			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p>
		Create a session with the kind of movies you all want to watch and pick a unique (but memorable!) session name. You can narrow the movies down based on release years, genre, and any streaming services you have. 
<br/><br/>
You also need to specify how many likes a movie needs before you get a match. For example, if three of you are trying to pick something, set this to three.  <br/><br/> Once you’ve created a session, share the name with everyone else and start swiping through movies. Once a movie gets enough likes you'll all be notified.
